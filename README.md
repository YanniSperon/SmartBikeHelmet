# SmartBikeHelmet

Arduino code for a prototype helmet-embedded smart helmet that added turn signals to a bike helmet. Also includes Arduino code for controlling the turn signals through hand movements with the optional glove component, or accelerometer data from the helmet.

Is meant to be paired with an iOS app which is written in SceneKit, UIKit, and Swift. Current state of the software is incomplete, but the core functionality is there. All software and hardware was written by and wired by me (Yanni Speron).
